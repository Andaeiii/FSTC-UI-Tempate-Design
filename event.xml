		<fname>Tonye</fname>
		<lname>Princewill</lname>
		<bio>Prince Tonye Princewill, fondly called 'TP' by friends, followers and political associates has acquired the enviable reputation as a different kind of politician; a cut above the rest of clamoring politicians who see politics as an end in itself rather than a means to offer service to the electorate. Many who know the Kalabari Prince or have had close dealings with him attest to the passion with which he pursues what he believes in. Due to his penchant for doing things differently, he has been dubbed the "digital" politician of our time.#br#br
A believer in the maxim that politics is too serious a business to be left to politicians, Prince Tonye Princewill was first brought into national limelight in 2007 when he contested for the governorship position of Rivers state, on the platform of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) against Mr. Celestine Omehia, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate. After the highly spirited electoral battle, Mr. Celestine Omehia was declared the winner of the highly contentious election by the Independent National electoral Commission (INEC). #br#br
To protest against the injustice of his stolen mandate, Tonye Princewill challenged the declared victory of Mr Omehia in the Election tribunal and was on the path of victory when the Supreme Court overturned Omehia’s victory and declared Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi as the duly elected governor of Rivers state.
As a highly principled politician who puts his people’s interest over and above his quest for political office, Princewill dropped the legal challenge against the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and joined forces with Governor Rotimi Amaechi in the larger interest of the Rivers people. This he did with the full backing of the Action Congress (ACN) in Rivers state.  Following this principled position, Tonye Princewill later cast his lot for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). He has since remained in the PDP, offering his advice to the Federal and Rivers state governments on issues concerning the people of Rivers state while also carrying out humanitarian causes on matters that are dear to him.
Prior to his foray into the political arena, Prince Tonye Princewill had made good as a successful businessman. Riverdrill Group of Companies (Nigeria), the company he founded and which he is Chairman is a private business concern with interests inOil and Gas, Information Technology, Environmental Waste, Aviation services and consulting, among other varied interests.#br#br
Tonye Princewill did not just set out to be a businessman, however! His early career was kick-startedwhen he started work as a Reservoir and Well-site Petroleum Engineer. Some other organizations where he cut his professional teeth include the UK's Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency, the Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom) where he worked as a Risk Analyst. He was at some point the Chief Technology Officer of Panasonic in the United Kingdom and also served at the Global Asset Management desk of Citibank.
To prepare him for the active political and private life that he leads, Prince Tonye Princewill, born in the UK to the royal family of King T. J. T. Princewill, theAmanyanabo of Kalabari Kingdom in Rivers State, a former Professor of Medical Microbiology before he became a monarch, hebegan his primary education in the United Kingdom. On returning to Nigeria with his parents, he continued his education at Hillcrest High School in Jos (1976-1980). He completed his High School education and obtained his West African Senior Certificate/General Certificate of Education at the Federal Government College (Port Harcourt) in 1985. He holds a BSc degree in Petroleum Engineering at the University of Port Harcourt and later acquired a Master's degree in Mineral Resources Engineering at the Imperial College London.Princewill also holds a PRINCE 2 Project Management Practitioner Certificate from the United Kingdom.#br#br
A dogged advocate for youth empowerment in Nigeria, Princewill has started several initiatives aimed at inspiring the youths andsteering them away from violence and militancy in the Niger Delta towards positive developments of their talents and leadership skills.In June 2012, for instance, Prince Tonye Princewill sponsored and led a 10-man delegation of Nigerian youths, under the aegis of Change Nigeria Group, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirate and Accra, Ghanafor acquisition of knowledge on entrepreneurship, governance, leadership and self-development.#br#br
In addition to his advocacy for youths, Tonye Princewill through his Princewill Trust engages in many humanitarian activities in aid of disadvantaged people and communities, especially in the Niger Delta. A recent humanitarian mission organized by Princewill Trust and personally led Prince TonyePrincewill was the relief work done to bring about relief and succor to several communities that were ravaged by flood in 2013.#br#br
As a result of Tonye Princewill’s sheer dynamism which is constantly on display in his result–oriented activities, be it in the public sector or his private endeavor, he has come under tremendous pressure to run again for the office of governor of River state. Concerned deeply about the current condition of his Rivers state people, Princewill is consulting with his associates and constituents before making a concrete pronouncement on his political future.
A well-grounded family man, Tonye Princewill is husband to Rosemary and father to a delightful daughter and a lovely set of twin boys.
